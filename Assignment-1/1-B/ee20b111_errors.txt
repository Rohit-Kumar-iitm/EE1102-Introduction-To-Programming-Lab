 #include <stdio.h>
                                     // "int main()" function declaration//
{
	int p, t;
	float m;                        //float m,r; float variable r was not declared//
	printf("Enter the required details:\n");
	printf("Principal (Rs): ");
	scanf("%d", &p)                 //sentence is not closed using semicolon(;) corrected form is scanf("%d", &p);
	printf("Rate of interest (%%): ");
	scanf("%f", &r);
	printf("Number of days: ");
	scanf("%d", &t);
	m = p * r / 100 * (t / 365);
	printf("Maturity amount is Rs. %f\n", m);
	return 0;
}

Above is the given program.
The mistakes are found in program and are : 
In 2nd line main() declaration is not done , which can be corrected by writing 'int main()'.
In 5th line the float variable r was not declared , which is used in program . That can be corrected bu writing float m,r; instead of float m;.
In 8th line the scanf syntax is not closed by a semicolon , which can be corrected by using ; and write it as scanf("%d", &p);.
So correction are : 
In 2nd line , int main()            //declare it before curly brackets '{'//
In 5th line , float m,r;
In 8th line , scanf("%d", &p);
